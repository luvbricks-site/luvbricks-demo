        About LuvBricks
      </h2>

      <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
        LuvBricks exists to help fans <strong>build more and spend smart</strong>. We curate the sets people actually want,
        price them clearly with <strong>tier-based bundle savings</strong> that apply at checkout, and reward every
        registered customer with <strong>LuvPoints (1 pt per $1)</strong>. Orders ship fast—usually within 24 hours—and we pack
        like collectors: secure, clean, and ready for display or gifting. Our goal is simple: fewer hoops, better value,
        and a shopping experience that respects your time and your hobby.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
        We’re building a community around fair deals, honest availability, and dependable service. That means safe
        promotions, transparent taxes and shipping, and responsive support when you need a hand. Whether you’re new to
        bricks or planning your next big MOC, we want LuvBricks to be the place you start.

        “I started LuvBricks because I love the feeling of opening and building a great set—and I hated how hard it was to find
        real value without jumping through gimmicks. LuvBricks is my promise to deliver <strong>great sets, fair prices,
        and collector-grade care</strong> every time.”
